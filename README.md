âœˆ FLIGHTS DATA ANALYSIS

This project analyzes flight datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and insights in the aviation industry. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to understand factors affecting flight schedules, ticket pricing, and airline performance.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

Analyze airlines and their flight counts
Show departure time & arrival time distributions with counts
Display destination city and source city counts
Create a categorical plot showing average ticket price by airline and travel class

ðŸ“Š Key Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing for accurate analysis
EDA using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
Visualizing flight trends, city connections, and airline performance
Identifying patterns in ticket prices by airline and class

ðŸ“Œ Key Visualizations

Horizontal bar chart: Airlines vs. Flight Counts
Bar charts: Departure Time & Arrival Time distributions
Horizontal bar charts: Destination City counts & Source City counts
Categorical plot: Average Ticket Price by Airline and Class
